# Scheduling for Computer Science
### What Faculty should look at
- [Fall Schedule by instructor](schedule_Fall_2026_by_instructor.csv)
- [Winter Schedule by instructor](schedule_Winter_2027_by_instructor.csv)
- [Spring Schedule by instructor](schedule_Spring_2027_by_instructor.csv)
- [Summer Schedule by instructor](schedule_Spring_2027_by_instructor.csv)

- See if the classes you are scheduled to teach are what you expected.
- See if the time and location will work for you.

### Notation
The room schedule files show when rooms are used ([Fall](room_schedule_Fall_2026.csv), [Winter](room_schedule_Winter_2027.csv), [Spring](room_schedule_Spring_2027.csv), [Summer](room_schedule_Summer_2027.csv))
- An X in the schedule file indicates that this time has a conflict with another time that is currently scheduled (For example, if there is a MW class scheduled in a room, then MWF would have an X)
- A 0 in the schedule file indicates that the room does not have priority 1 scheduling for the Computer Science Department.

### Conflicts  
Please check the conflicts files for [Fall](conflicts_Fall_2026.csv), [Winter](conflicts_Winter_2026.csv), [Spring](conflicts_Spring_2026.csv), [Summer](conflicts_Summer_2026.csv) to see if there are classes that students would need to take together that are offered at the same time.

### Report
This [report](scheduling_report.md) will show you all of the details of the scheduling software along with the constraints that it is using for scheduling rooms.  I find it very interesting to see the improvement in room utilization and times that has occured using an automated scheduler.
