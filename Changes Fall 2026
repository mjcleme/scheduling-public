Move 704R from Winter to Fall for Morse

Change Cluff 111 for Winter to 5pm
Delete Cluff Fall

Move Mercer 686 Fall to after 10.
Winter 2027, CS 224 needs to move to 10:00 or in the afternoon.

Archibald For Winter 2027, I have set up 224 to be Tue/Thu instead of MWF so I would prefer that.  Additionally, if I am doing two sections, it really helps to have them back to back.

Fall 2026
CS 430 TTh 2-3:15pm somewhere in the TMCB, even low capacity (like any
conference room)
CS 330 TTh 3:30-4:45pm TMCB 120 (this was 430's slot so it should be free)

Winter 2027
CS 630 TTh 2-3:15pm somewhere in the TMCB, even low capacity (this is
just a room change)
CS 330 TTh 3:30-4:45pm somewhere in the TMCB or maybe JKB

As you may know CS 480 and 481 are really one course, but for historical reasons they are officially two courses. 
Anyway I wonder if there is a way to schedule them in the same room. 
Otherwise we would have to move locations midway through a lecture.

Yes, i can trade with Angela so she has MW 9:30 in fall. I'll take Tu Th 9:30 fall. Hopefully it's easy to just change names without rerunning the algorithm. 
Mark, I have a grad class TuTh 9:30 fall but I can move it. Instead of generating a random teaching time based on classroom availability, can I just teach TuTh 12:45-2 in my lab (tmcb 3325)
Let's just go with the normal 12:30-1:45 time then for the grad class that doesnt need a room.

Fall 2026: For CS 580 next fall, I am scheduled at 11am on MW in TMCB 134.  Could we please add Friday in the same room at the same time?  
CS 580 needs a room for a recitation, so we found it is easiest to schedule the class for MWF with Friday participation being optional.

Winter 2027:  
First, CS 513 should not be taught at the same time as CS 677.  
We had to change my times for 513 next semester (winter 2026) precisely because they were scheduled at the same time and students needed to take both.  
Could we move CS 677 to TTH 2-3:15 to resolve this conflict?  (I moved 513 from TTH to MW winter 26 to resolve this conflict--can we keep the same pattern?)
I feel like the 11 students enrolled in 513 will drown in MARB 130.  If we move CS 677 to TTH, that would open up TMCB 120 which is half the size and would fit CS 513 much better.
Also, could we add an (optional) Friday recitation for CS 513 in the same room at the same time, and
Is there any way that 712 could be held in the same room immediately following CS 513 (MW 3:30-4:45 TMCB 120)?  
If the same room isn't available, maybe 712 could still be at that time (MW 3:30-4:45) but in a smaller room (usually the number of students for 712 will be between 5 and 10 students, so even the little conference room next to IDeA Labs would be great--that's where we did it last time).

In the spring, 4pm is good, and I would prefer 5pm in the Fall/Winter.
