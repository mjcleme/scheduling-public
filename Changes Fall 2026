Move 704R from Winter to Fall for Morse

Change Cluff 111 for Winter to 5pm
Delete Cluff Fall

Move Mercer 686 Fall to after 10.
Winter 2027, CS 224 needs to move to 10:00 or in the afternoon.

Archibald For Winter 2027, I have set up 224 to be Tue/Thu instead of MWF so I would prefer that.  Additionally, if I am doing two sections, it really helps to have them back to back.

Fall 2026
CS 430 TTh 2-3:15pm somewhere in the TMCB, even low capacity (like any
conference room)
CS 330 TTh 3:30-4:45pm TMCB 120 (this was 430's slot so it should be free)

Winter 2027
CS 630 TTh 2-3:15pm somewhere in the TMCB, even low capacity (this is
just a room change)
CS 330 TTh 3:30-4:45pm somewhere in the TMCB or maybe JKB
