Move 704R from Winter to Fall for Morse

Change Cluff 111 for Winter to 5pm
Delete Cluff Fall

Move Mercer 686 Fall to after 10.
Winter 2027, CS 224 needs to move to 10:00 or in the afternoon.

Archibald For Winter 2027, I have set up 224 to be Tue/Thu instead of MWF so I would prefer that.  Additionally, if I am doing two sections, it really helps to have them back to back.

Fall 2026
CS 430 TTh 2-3:15pm somewhere in the TMCB, even low capacity (like any
conference room)
CS 330 TTh 3:30-4:45pm TMCB 120 (this was 430's slot so it should be free)

Winter 2027
CS 630 TTh 2-3:15pm somewhere in the TMCB, even low capacity (this is
just a room change)
CS 330 TTh 3:30-4:45pm somewhere in the TMCB or maybe JKB

As you may know CS 480 and 481 are really one course, but for historical reasons they are officially two courses. 
Anyway I wonder if there is a way to schedule them in the same room. 
Otherwise we would have to move locations midway through a lecture.

Yes, i can trade with Angela so she has MW 9:30 in fall. I'll take Tu Th 9:30 fall. Hopefully it's easy to just change names without rerunning the algorithm. 
Mark, I have a grad class TuTh 9:30 fall but I can move it. Instead of generating a random teaching time based on classroom availability, can I just teach TuTh 12:45-2 in my lab (tmcb 3325)
Let's just go with the normal 12:30-1:45 time then for the grad class that doesnt need a room.

Fall 2026: For CS 580 next fall, I am scheduled at 11am on MW in TMCB 134.  Could we please add Friday in the same room at the same time?  
CS 580 needs a room for a recitation, so we found it is easiest to schedule the class for MWF with Friday participation being optional.

Winter 2027:  
First, CS 513 should not be taught at the same time as CS 677.  
We had to change my times for 513 next semester (winter 2026) precisely because they were scheduled at the same time and students needed to take both.  
Could we move CS 677 to TTH 2-3:15 to resolve this conflict?  (I moved 513 from TTH to MW winter 26 to resolve this conflict--can we keep the same pattern?)
I feel like the 11 students enrolled in 513 will drown in MARB 130.  If we move CS 677 to TTH, that would open up TMCB 120 which is half the size and would fit CS 513 much better.
Also, could we add an (optional) Friday recitation for CS 513 in the same room at the same time, and
Is there any way that 712 could be held in the same room immediately following CS 513 (MW 3:30-4:45 TMCB 120)?  
If the same room isn't available, maybe 712 could still be at that time (MW 3:30-4:45) but in a smaller room (usually the number of students for 712 will be between 5 and 10 students, so even the little conference room next to IDeA Labs would be great--that's where we did it last time).

In the spring, 4pm is good, and I would prefer 5pm in the Fall/Winter.

Right now I have two different classes back to back.  I would prefer to have space between them (one was at 9:30am before).  If you put them like that to help you, then definitely leave them as is; I’ll be fine.  But, if you put them like that to help me and it’s easy to put of them at 9:30 instead, I think I’d prefer that.

Looking at Bean for Fall:

This schedule currently has be doing back-to-back MW classes from 11-12:15 and 12:30-1:45. This leaves me no time for lunch those days. I do like eating lunch.

Also, my third class (401R) is TTH 12:30-1:45. I typically participate in the Faculty Learning Community each semester which happens on either a W or a Th during the lunch hour. With classes during lunch hour every day, I have no option there. I’d prefer at least one of those days to not have a lunch-time class. 

My 401R (either semester) doesn’t need a scheduled classroom (you can leave it TBD). We usually meet in a conference room or in my office. This makes it easier to schedule. 

Looking at CS 110 for Fall:

I see we have 5 sections of 110 in very large rooms, with a total capacity of about 1000. We only have about 500 in-person students in a Fall semester. I’m not sure we all need such large rooms - some of the sections could probably be smaller.

I see Bruce’s evening class is much later than he usually teaches it. I’ve reached out to him to double check that he’s aware and OK with the change.

Also, having Bruce teach so late on the second day of the lecture cadence makes it impossible for his students to attend a lab section (see below re: CS 110 labs).

Looking at CS 110 for Winter:

You have Angela and me both teaching large sections MW at 9:30am. We have a room that fits 285 at that time—we don’t need a second section at the same time. I think a primary reason we have more sections of 110 is so we can teach at different times of day to accommodate the large variety of students trying to take the course. 

And while not required, it sure is nice to have everyone on the same day when we can. In Fall with Angela and Xinru and their incompatible schedules, we deal with it. But Winter is usually our chance to have everyone on the MW cadence. 

Looking at CS 312 for Winter:

I only anticipate about 225 students that Winter in CS 312 (we’ve never had more than 234 in Winter and enrollments appear to be going down). Right now you have us with capacity for 770 students. Those will be large, empty rooms. I think we’d both (Gordon, David) prefer rooms closer to predicted capacity. 

My 401R doesn’t need a classroom.

CS 110 Labs

CS 110 is currently designed to have a lecture followed by a lab (which can optionally be done in a lab section) followed by HW that is due before the next lecture.

The ideal is: everyone teaches lecture MW; labs are later MW and early TTH; students finish HW TTH and are ready for lecture the next day. 

When someone teaches TTH (e.g. Xinru, Bruce), we have to put lab sections later in the day TTH that her students can attend. For Bruce’s students, we staff on evening lab section immediately after his class so they have the option. 

If we were to hold a lab option WF for his students, it would get REALLY confusing for the students to know which lab sections are compatible with their lecture selection. 

My recommendation is to leave Bruce’s evening section time alone and keep the existing lab section schedule. It’s been fine tuned over the past few years to accommodate consistent patterns in demand. 

Thanks for your work in all this.

Hi Mark, currently I'm scheduled to teach CS 110 on TTH from 6:30-7:45pm both semesters next year. I can now teach a MW schedule if that is preferred. I would also prefer to teach from 4:00-5:15pm, and was hoping to teach at least one section of CS 111 next year (I was originally signed up to teach 111 in Winter 2026 but was bumped from that). Is any of that possible?

My class schedule for Fall 2026 and Spring 2027 need to be adjusted. Details are as follows:

  1) According to the schedule, I am supported to teach CS 653 in Fall 2026 on MW from 9:00 am to 10:50 am. Since CS 653 is a 3-credit-hour class, each class lecture should be 75 minutes, not 120 minutes. That means the class should end at 10:15 am, not 10:50 am.


2) In Spring 2027, I am scheduled to teach CS 453 on MWF from 1:00 pm to 1:50 pm. However, since CS 453 is a 3-credit-hour class, my lecture should last for 2 hours, not 1 hour.
